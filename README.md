This project is shape identification.

NOTE: Please Download the data given in the link file and run the program in Jupyter Notebook after changing the base directory. 
If running on Google Collab, make sure to choose TPU runtime as TPU is much optimised for running Tensor Module. 
if any other runtime is selected, then it will exhaust the memory available in the free version of collab and will crash the kernel. 
Moreover, Google Collab is a stand-alone IDE and is not well-optimised for local system integration, 
whereas Jupyter Notebook runs on a local system, making it easier to use local machinery such as a webcam.

NOTE: Data can be accessed in Google Collab by uncommenting the link to drive code and changing the base directory to drive.

We used TensorFlow to make the model.
Data Source: Kaggle and open Internet.
We did not use any AI for this project. 
We have coded it ourselves by seeing tutorials on Youtube and reading on the internet, 
we all are beginners with only experience to coding as IDC101.
Hence This code may not be perfect or good or may not be very efficinet, may even contain some errors,
but atleast it is all honest hardwork, We hope it matters...
