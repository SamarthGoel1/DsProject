This project is shape identification.
NOTE: Please Download the data given in the link file and run the program in Jupyter Notebook after changing the base directory. If running on Google Collab, make sure to choose TPU runtime as TPU is much optimised for running Tensor Module. if any other runtime is selected then it will exhaust memory available in the free version of collab and will crash the kernel.
NOTE: Data can be accessed in Google Collab by uncommenting the link to drive code and changing base directory to drive.
We used TensorFlow to make the model.
Data Source: Kaggle and open Internet.
We did not use any AI for this project
